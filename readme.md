Remot.io is a simple, no install controller for html based presentations. Well, actually it can be used with on page that listenes for keyboard events or has a javascript API. The remot.io configuration can easily be extended to call a custom method depending on the page the bookmarklet has been run on.

- Triggering keyboard events only works as expected in Chrome and Firefox. Have not been able to set the keyCode on a keyboard event in Safari and have not done any testing in IE yet. Ideas, solutions, contributions are welcome! Just visit http://github.com/suhajdab/remot.io and share your insight.
